I'll do some explaining, what you see below is a YAML configuration for pandoc,
a tool that I use to convert markdown to any document format. People tend to
like the style of pandoc when exported and it looks a lot like the instruction
documents that professors will hand out to students.

NOTE: This text is inside HTML comment tags and will not be parsed by pandoc.
We could write anything we want in here and nobody will see it in the generated
pdf file.

# List of things to add

- What will your program do? State precisely the problem that it will solve.
- What will the user interaction look like? How will the program take the input?
- How will it return the output to the user?
- What datatypes will be used internally by the program? How will the inputs
  be parsed into internal representations?
- Give a brief outline of the process by which the program will attain its
  goal. A good answer could include the datatype(s) definition, a list of
  functions to be implemented, a one-line description of what each function
  does, and pseudocode for a main method that will call them in sequence.
  (At this point, you do not have to give the pseudocode for individual
  functions.)
- If you intend to work in a group, list the name(s) of who you will work with.

# Project Description

The basis of this project is simple, to convert markdown into HTML. The reason a
program like this is important, or why somebody may want to use it, is that
markdown is ultimately easier to write and easier to read than HTML. In this
case, using such a tool could be beneficial to save time and energy spent by web
developers.

The user would interact with this program by invoking the program with
`converter <input> <output>`. In the example `converter file.md file.html`,
`file.md` represents the input file and`file.html` represents the output file.
The program then parses the input file and writes the resulting HTML code in the
output file. For example, in the markdown file, we may have the code
`# Heading 1`, but once the code is converted into an HTML file, the resulting
conversion would look like `<h1>Heading 1</h1>`. Another example would be if we
had the markdown  code `**Bold Letters**`, the resulting HTML code would appear
as `<b>Bold Letters</b>`. After the program has finished executing and
successfully converted the markdown into HTML, the new HTML file will be
downloaded to the user's computer. If the program's execution is  not successful
due to any reason, an error message will be displayed instead.

The internal data types are very simple. HTML and Markdown are both text markup
languages. This means they both do the same thing: represent a formatted
document to the user. Since they are both used for the same purpose, they have
many elements in common. The only realistic difference is how that document
structure is generated. In HTML, there are two types of elements called `block`
level elements and `inline` level elements. All inline elements exist inside
block level elements. A webpage is made up of one or more block level elements.
For this reason, our main structure called `document` will simply be a list of
block types. Our `block` type will contain representations of HTML's typical
block elements like ordered lists, unordered lists, paragraphs, and code blocks.
Each block element can contain any number of inline elements, such as
unformatted text, inline code, bold or italic text, links, and other items
typically found in a paragraph. We will use a parser and lexer similar to our
homework and in class assignments. Our lexer will detect syntax symbols and
convert them into tokens. We will then use a parser to reconstruct the document
from the lexer output.

Our actual implementation will be very simple. Starting in `main`, it will call
a function called `getArgs` to determine the input and output files and also
handle any errors that may occur. Main will then read the file and call `lexer`
and `parser` to generate the `document` data type defined in the previous
paragraph. Once the internal data representation is obtained, a function
`printHTML` will take in a document object and return a `string` with the HTML
code. The string is then written to a file inside the main function and the
program exits.

# Example Implementation and Psudocode

```hs
-- data types
type Text = String
data Document = [Block]
data Inline = Normal Text       -- normal text
            | Bold Text         -- bold text
            | Italic Text       -- italic text
            | Preformatted Text -- inline code
data Block = UL [Inline]        -- Unordered List
           | OL [Inline]        -- Ordered List
           | Paragraph [Inline] -- Paragraph
           | Code [Text]        -- Code block
data Token = Star               -- used for bold/italic
           | Dash               -- used for unordered lists
           | BackTick           -- used for code/preformatted text
           | NewLine            -- used to shorten lines or end a block
           | B Block            -- preparsed Block type
           | I Inline           -- preparsed Inline type
           | T Text             -- preparsed Text type

-- function definitions
getArgs :: IO [String] -- this is defined in the System.Environment package
getFiles :: IO [String] -> [String, String]
lexer :: String -> [Token]
parser :: [Tokens] -> [Block]
printHTML :: [Block] -> String]

-- pseudocode for main
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let infile outfile = getFiles getArgs
  let mdText = read infile
  let lexed = lexer mdText
  let parsed = parser lexed
  let html = printHTML parsed
  write html outfile
  print "OK."
```
